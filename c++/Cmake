Cmake creates makefiles that run commands to make
Cmake relies on a top level file called: CMakeLists.txt
cmake -S ../../ -B .  //this means that the source is 2 directories back and the build directory is the current dir

inside the CMakeLists.txt:
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.13.4) //this should be your cmake version

project(botproject)

add_executeable(${PROJECT_NAME} main.cpp)   //the project name references the project variable that we have set in line above 

-----------------Libraries and subdirectories---------------
Suppose we have our file structure:
Botproject-
  --Adder
    adder.cpp
    adder.h
    CMakeLists.txt
  --Out
    CMakeLists.txt
    main.cpp
    
adder.h contains the definition of functions in adder.cpp:
float add(float a, float b);
    
In the Out/CMakeLists.txt we have:
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.13.4)

project(botproject)

add_executeable(${PROJECT_NAME} main.cpp)

add_subdirectory(Adder);

target_include_directories(${PROJECT_NAME} PUBLIC Adder)

target_link_directories(${PROJECT_NAME} Adder)

target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} adder);


In the Adder/CMakeLists.txt we have:
add_library(adder adder.cpp)
