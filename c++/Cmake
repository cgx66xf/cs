Cmake creates makefiles that run commands to make
Cmake relies on a top level file called: CMakeLists.txt
cmake -S ../../ -B .  //this means that the source is 2 directories back and the build directory is the current dir

inside the CMakeLists.txt:
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.13.4) //this should be your cmake version

project(botproject)

add_executeable(${PROJECT_NAME} main.cpp)   //the project name references the project variable that we have set in line above 

-----------------Libraries and subdirectories---------------
Suppose we have 2 files in our project: main.cpp, adder.cpp

cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.13.4)

project(botproject)

add_executeable(${PROJECT_NAME} main.cpp adder.cpp)
